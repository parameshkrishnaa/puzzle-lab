			<h4>Abstract</h4>

			<p>In multilingual societies such as India, effective communication in healthcare is often obstructed by language barriers, especially in clinical interactions between patient and their healthcare providers, in documents provided by the hospitals for the patient’s use (patient-facing documents like consent to treatment/research participation, information sheets, discharge summaries etc).  </p>

			<p>This workshop will explore the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computational Linguistics (CL), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create effective mediums of language translation systems that can be tailored for healthcare use cases. We will identify use cases that medical professionals and patients find challenging, explore available systems that can help translating medical information into patient-friendly language, various Indian languages, implementing multilingual speech recognition for clinical documentation, and automating content contextualization through AI. The primary goal is to unite researchers and professionals from linguistics, healthcare, and AI to collaboratively develop solutions that facilitate better communication in multilingual and fast-paced healthcare environments.  </p>

		</div><div class="section" id="introduction">
			<h4>Introduction </h4>
			
			<p>Communication is key between patients and their healthcare providers. However, this process can be challenging due to the vulnerable state of patients and the busy environment in which many Indian clinicians function, given the large volume of patients seen each day. In a linguistically diverse country like India, these challenges are often magnified. Patients often struggles to communicate with clinicians, read and information provided to them due to limited language literacy. Clinicians often struggle to input data into structured Electronic Health Records (EHRs), which take their time from having meaningful conversations with patients. As a result, the electronic capture of data in India is often alarmingly low. </p>

			<p>This workshop aims to discuss some of these issues by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computational Linguistics (CL), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create language-agnostic tools for patient-facing documents and better tools that can capture speech-to-text to facilitate clinical data capture.  </p>
		</div>
		<div class="section" id="objectives">
			<h4>The workshop has the following objectives:  </h4>
			<ol>
			<li>
				Identify key challenges in translating healthcare documents and capturing speech data across Indian languages. 
			</li>
			<li>     Explore language technology oriented solutions for contextual and culturally appropriate translations.  </li>
			<li>
				Can Multilingual speech recognition be an effective tool for capturing patient interactions and clinical notes efficiently? 
			</li>
			<li>
				Discuss real world use cases in patient care, such as consent forms, information sheets, and discharge summaries 
			</li>
			<li>
				Promote interdisciplinary collaboration between Language AI experts, Linguistics, healthcare professionals, and AI researchers. 

			</li>
